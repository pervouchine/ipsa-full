1) aggregate.pl

This utility aggregates tsv output of sjcount by the 5th column (offset) and outputs BED6+3 with three extra columns being (7) total count, (8) staggered read count, (9) entropy
	-maxintron, max intron length, default=0
	-minintron, min intron length, default=0
	-readLength, the read length, default=0
	-margin, the margin for offset, default=0
	-tsv, the input file, OBLIGATORY

2) annotate.pl

This utility takes an aggregated BED6+3 file, the genomic annotation, and the genome, and outputs BED6+3+2 with two more columns: (10) annotation status and (11) splice sites
If BED6+3 was strandless ('.' in column 6) then each line will be reported twice, one for '+' and and for '-' strand
	-bed, the input file, OBLIGATORY
	-idx, the genome (idx), OBLIGATORY
	-dbx, the genome (dbx), OBLIGATORY
	-annot, the annotation (gtf), OBLIGATORY

3) biorep.pl
*** this is an auxiliary program to select by bioreplicates ***

4) choose_strand.pl

This utility takes a BED6+3+2 file, where (10) is the annotation status and (11) is splice sites, and selects for each pair of beg/end the strand based on these two columns
	-bed, input file, OBLIGATORY
	-sites, splice site column, default=11
	-annot, annotation column, default=10

5) constrain_ssc.pl

This utility takes a BED6 ssc file and constraints its content to splice sites which are present in BED6 ssj file
	-sites, splice site column, default=11
	-ssc, input ssc (bed) file, OBLIGATORY
	-ssj, input ssj (bed) file, OBLIGATORY
	-annot, annotation column, default=10

6) make.pm

*** perl module with all important routines ***

7) merge_gff.pl

*** a utility to merge geff files into square tables based on features ***

8) sjpipe.pl

*** a utility to generate the splicing pipeline ***

9) transcript_elements.pl

*** a utility to generate transcript elements from a gff ***

10) tx.pl
This utility computes exon inclusion rates based on the quantifiaction data
	-minc, the minimum sum of rpkms to consider the inclusion ratio as reliable, default=0
	-quant, the transcript quantification file (gtf/gff), OBLIGATORY
	-annot, the genomic annotation, OBLIGATORY

11) zeta.pl
This utility computes (a) the global exon inclusion and processing rates for a given set of annotated exons and (b) inclusion and processing rates of SJs
	-stranded, 1(yes) or 0(no), default=1
	-ssc, the input ssc (BED) file
	-ssj, the input ssj (BED) file, OBLIGATORY
	-mincount, the min value of the denominator of the fraction, default=20
	-annot, the annotation (GTF) file, OBLIGATORY
